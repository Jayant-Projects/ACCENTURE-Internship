# Accenture Data Analyst Project - Social Buzz

Welcome to the GitHub Readme for my Accenture Data Analyst project with Social Buzz. In this project, I had the opportunity to work under the guidance of Accenture's Managing Director, Mae Mulligan, as part of a diverse team of experts assembled to address Social Buzz's specific needs. Below, I'll provide an overview of the project and my contributions.

## Project Overview

### Client and Business Problem
Social Buzz is our client, and they approached Accenture with a specific business problem. The client needed assistance in analyzing various datasets to gain insights into content trends, which would inform their strategic decisions in the realm of social media.

### Project Requirements
Our task was to provide Social Buzz with actionable insights derived from data analysis. To meet this goal, we focused on several key areas:

1. **Data Cleaning and Modeling:**
   - I meticulously cleaned and modeled diverse datasets, ensuring data hygiene by eliminating nulls and duplicates.
   - Effective integration of data streams using tools like VLOOKUP, streamlining the data for analysis.

2. **Visual Storytelling:**
   - Leveraged visual storytelling techniques, including bar charts and pie graphs, to reveal hidden patterns within the data.
   - This approach enhanced the clarity of our insights.

3. **Compelling Presentation:**
   - I took on the challenge of creating a compelling presentation using an Accenture-provided template.
   - The presentation encapsulated the project's essence, covering problem elucidation, team dynamics, our analytical journey, and visualization techniques.
   - It provided actionable insights and a roadmap for future growth.

4. **Engaging Client Presentation:**
   - Orchestrated a captivating client presentation, delivering it through a thoughtfully recorded video.
   - This presentation served as a testament to our dedication and proficiency, showcasing the results of our efforts.

## Key Accomplishments

In the course of this project, I achieved the following milestones:

- Cleaned, modeled, and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content trends.
